## What would I have done differently? 

1. Input -  I would have done differently to accept only numbers, here I did not do it, because supposedly type='input' should not be used according to [GOV.UK](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/24/why-the-gov-uk-design-system-team-changed-the-input-type-for-numbers/).
2. I would add filtering by ID to the URL. 
3. Styles - I would have done it nicer, but it's just that the days I have to do this task I am heavily swamped and working more than usual.
4. I didn't see the point of using the context api here, or the state management library, you can see my other recruitment task using the context api [HERE](https://github.com/adrianczesnowski/5faad7379315a035baab03e2d64f83c3)
5. I would probably write some tests, you can see an example in the same repository as the use of context api.
6. In addition, I would add better types, right now I just don't have that much time for it :c
